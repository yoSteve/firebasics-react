**Strengths:** Sam has the curiosity and drive which will serve him well in his pursuit of software development. He picks things up quickly and applies his newfound knowledge to whatever problem he is working on.

**Growth:** I would like to see Sam take on a greater diversity of projects. Different project present a different array of challenges. This will broaden Sam's experience by forcing him to overcome a new suite of problems. A good strategy for approaching new problems is to break them down into the smallest possible fragments, write small, reusable functions, and then use these functions to build up larger, more complex programs. This strategy helps with clarity and readability.

# Firebasics (The basics of Firebase)

Firebase is an app development platform, built and maintained by Google, that speeds up app development because it provides a _Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)_. Firebase eliminates the need to write and maintain server-side code - things like user authentication, trusted API calls, security logic, database connections, traffic scaling, and the list goes on. Firebase makes this possible by providing you with a variety of frontend _xxSoftware Development Kits (SDKs)_ that connect your web/mobile apps to various Google Cloud Resources.

How can we use Firebase to simplify our app development?

- Setup basic user auth with Google Sign-In. (authentication)
- Create Firestore database records and listen to changes in realtime. (firestore)
- Use the Firebase CLI Tools to manage and deploy an app. (hosting)


## How to connect your app to Firebase

1. Create a new project on https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Click on the _Web </>_ button to add a project for web.
3. Fill in the _"app nickname" field an submit the form.
3. Grab the `firebaseConfig` object generated by Firebase and store it in a `secrets.js` file in the `/src` directory _(eg. `/src/secrets.js`)_.
4. In the Firebase Console side-nav, drill down to **Build > Authentication > Get started**.
  - Here you should enable your preferred sign-in method(s) _(eg. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Email/Password)_
  - _**TIP:**_ Keep the default config options for each sign-in method.
5. In the Firebase Console side-nav,  drill down to **Build > Firestore Database > Create database**.
  - Set name (default) and location (Montreal)
  - Secure rules: "Start in test mode" <-- we will lock this down later

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
